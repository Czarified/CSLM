# CSLM
Community Starship Loads Model Experiment


## What is this?
This repository is an experiment with a project I just can't stop thinking about. SpaceX is developing a massive new vehicle which represents many engineering challenges. Among these are the structural and material challenges with it's unique launch and mission profile. This project aims to develop a simple Loads Model to explore and visualize these effects.

## What is a Loads Model?
In typical aerospace vehicle design, a very coarse Finite Element Model is used to explore major design decisions and accurately distribute loads across the airframe. With its results, the External Loads can be applied and the Internal Loads can be retrieved, which can then be used for detailed analysis.

## Why Are You Doing This?
While, yes, it is a great deal of work to produce, and the results cannot be entirely utilized by the community, I am starting this project for a couple main reasons:
1. I think it would be cool!
2. I can't stop thinking about it!

Hopefully the CLSM could lead to some interesting discussion or amateur analysis, but the intent of this project is not to do SpaceX's work for them, define the only way to design a vehicle, or commit corporate espionage.

## Who is the Intended Audience? What is the "Community?"
In my mind, the main audience are the wonderful nerd over at [r/spacex](www.reddit/com/r/spacex), but anyone is welcome to join in.

## How!??
Maybe later...
