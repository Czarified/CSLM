   MSC Nastran brings powerful new features and enhancements for engineering
   solutions.
  
  
     HPC
     -  The performance of extraction of eigenmodes using ACMS has been improved
          using SMP. This is applicable for SOL 103, SOL 111, SOL 200 and
          SOL 400.
     -  The solution of linear equations encountered in SOL 101,107,108,111 and
          SOL 200 has been improved when using the Intel MKL Pardiso solver for
          SMP.
     -  Element stiffness and stress recovery has been parallelized in SOL 400
          using SMP.
  
     Acoustics
     -  The Equivalent Radiated Power (ERP) capability now supports higher order
          shell elements and solid elements. The Modal Participation Factor(MPF)
          can be obtained and the output has been improved.
     -  For acoustic analysis it is also possible to output the velocity normal
          to the surface and the vibrational intensity.
1    -  An interface to utilize Digimat frequency dependent material properties
          has been added for SOL 108 and SOL 111. This is available for MAT1,
          MAT2, MAT8 and MAT9 - NEW in 2016.1 release
  
     Optimization
     -  Global Optimization capability has been introduced to find the true
          optimal value as opposed to a potentially local optimum.
     -  Multi-Model optimization technique has been added that allows you to
          optimize the response across multiple simulation models.
     -  Optimization based upon Weight response associated with property or
          material id has been expanded to support topology optimization.
  
     Rotordynamics
     -  The rotordynamic capability has been expanded to support 3D behavior.
  
     Connector Technology
     -  Connector technology, CWELD, CFAST, and CSEAM connectors are improved:
     -  The elements can be used consistently for linear analysis and large
          displacement analysis (SOL 400).
     -  The projection algorithm has been improved.
     -  The connector elements may be used with finer meshes because the 3 by 3
          search algorithm has been replaced with a general algorithm.
     -   Force output is available in a SOL 400 simulation for ANALYSIS=NTRAN.
     -   Additional output capability to summarize the connector behavior.
  
     Implicit Nonlinear Analysis - SOL 400
     -  The segment-to-segment procedure has been made more robust.
     -  Large interference conditions is supported
     -  Gaps / clearance can be retained in contact simulations
     -  Beam contact, using the cross-section geometry is supported.
     -  Restart can now be performed with SOL 400 using advanced elements.
     -  It is possible to use advanced elements when creating a superelement.
  
     Explicit Nonlinear Analysis - SOL 700
     -  New material models have been added for creep and concrete behavior.
     -  Severely distorted elements may be eliminated in SPH simulation.
     -  Dynamic relaxation is available with body loads.
     -  A body may be inserted within another body to model rebars in concrete.
  
     Results Database
     -  Results may be output to an HDF5 results database
  
     F06 Reader - Provided Synopsis of Key Nastran Files (F06, F04 and LOG)
     - Model data summary
     - Links to MSC SimCompanion for Error and Warning Messages.
     - Link to local Quick Reference Guide (QRG)
     - XY-Plots of key global results like nonlinear convergence, design cycle,
        etc.
  
     Delivery
1    -   Win 7 32-bit is no longer available.
     -   The I4 and I8 installers have been split.
  
  
    Documentation
  
     The complete documentation set is provided in a separate installer and when
     installed is available at:
     MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/pdf_nastran directory.
     Where MSC_DOC_DIR is the directory where documentation was installed
     This help set has cross references between documents, links to how-to
     videos, and example files.
  
    Individual MSC Nastran documents are available for download from the
      Simcompanion Website at:
