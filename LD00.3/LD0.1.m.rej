$ Material Record : m_301SS
$ Description of Material :
$       Basic isotropic Stainless Steel 301. Material data comes from
$       MMPDS-13. Form is assumed to be sheet, and S-basis allowables are taken.
$       Basic density value is taken from matweb. This material is not dependent
$       on temperature, and the CTE used is for 100deg F.
$       For allowables, the lower value between L and LT directions is given,
$       and the values are for a temperature of 70deg F. The tensile ultimate
$       value is given, and the yield for compression and shear.
$       All data in SI units, as standard for CSLM LD0.1 (m, kg, Pa)
