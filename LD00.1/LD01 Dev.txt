06/26/19 Added - Basic Isotropic 301 SS
         TODO  - Groups file creation and better part groups.
         TODO  - Basic Uniaxial aero Loadcase and solve.

07/07/19 Added - Groups Session File.
         Added - Property card pshell.301.5
         Added - New property applied to all shells.
         Added - Nodal representation of center engine and RBE3 connection to octaweb. Engine node ID is
                 15000 and is SPC'd in all DOF to counteract applied aero loads.
       Removed - "Reaction" landing loads on fin-Legs.
       
07/22/19 Added - OpenVSP model and mesh.
       Removed - Old mesh files and lines drawings.
         Added - Load Development Notebook with basic functions for pressure derivation and EID list
                 extraction.
         
07/23/19 Added - Initial properties in VSP model for export and grouping. VSP automatically creates
                 SETs for each sub part, so this isn't completely necessary, but may make grouping easier.
 
07/26/19 Added - Importing multiple parts into a single Patran database seems to exceed the entity limits
                 on the Student Edition license. Unverified, but elements import and then disappear. Error
                 message upon closing seems to verify, but the numerical limit is still unknown. Some
                 simplification can be done on the wings and canards, but if just 3 "items" run into the
                 limit, major coarsening may be necessary just to stay under limit. Will try with
                 extremely coarse mesh.

07/26/19 Added - Mesh coarsened overall. 2 elements in the canard deck seemed to cause issues, so they
                 were commented out and import  was successful.
                 
07/27/19 Added - Group for work on the fin joint. Manually modifying elements to join all structural
                 items represents a massive amount of tedious work, and would have to be repeated, for
                 each geometry change, defeating the purpose of using the OpenVSP model.
         Added - Surfaces can be extracted from the mesh, for mesh seeding and remeshing as quads. This
                 is also labor-intensive, but is probably easier than keeping the individual part meshes
                 and manually joining them.
                 
07/28/19 Added - Imported surfaces of VSP structure in Patran. Crashed Patran when trying to trim. :(

07/29/19 Added - Imported IGES OML. Cut surface to have coincident edges, then mesh seeded, meshed, and
                 equivalenced, for a joined wing and fuselage section. :)
         TODO  - Cleanup fin mesh, so ribs and spars can be easily created.
                    To keep lines from "curling" keep root nodes equal to tip.
                    To orient rib nodes in line (without importing rib mesh), need to seed an
                    additional line in plane with the upper skin root edge.

08/09/19 Added - Trimmed fin surfaces at rib locations for rib meshes creation in proper planes.
         ERROR - Mesh seeds on the new cuts don't line up with the fuselage joint curves. For some reason
                 there seem to be 3 "hard points" at the fin leading edge, even when using uniform
                 seed settings. Meshing without the seeds seems to give the same results.
         FIX   - Global tolerance increase to 0.003 reduced automatic hard point creation during seeding.
                 Mesh seeds created for each edge of each surface and meshes match! :)

08/10/19 Added - Mesh for actuated fin and tail fin skins complete. Mesh for engine skirt and thrust plate.

08/13/19 Added - Mesh for skin regions connecting engine skirt to Lower Bulkhead Staion.

08/17/19 Added - Geometry for skin and remaining bulkheads/domes.

08/18/19 Added - Mesh for remaining skins and bulkheads. Equivalences all nodes.
                 Somehow deleted all progress from the past 2 days by closing after saving?
                 
08/23/19 Added - Mesh for canard and fuse skin. Equivalenced all existing mesh.
                 Almost recovered from crash!
                 
08/25/19 Added - Mesh for all airframe surfaces! Half mesh model equivalenced and verified.
                 Model Summary: 2252 nodes, 2589 elements.
                 
         TODO  - Compile as Exec Deck.
         TODO  - Assign basic properties (mat already defined)
         TODO  - Assign uniaxial balanced test loadcase.
         TODO  - Mirror Mesh.
         
08/25/19 Added - Test loadcase with fuel pressures solved successfully! Still need other 3 items above.
