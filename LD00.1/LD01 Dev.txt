06/26/19 Added - Basic Isotropic 301 SS
         TODO  - Groups file creation and better part groups.
         TODO  - Basic Uniaxial aero Loadcase and solve.

07/07/19 Added - Groups Session File.
         Added - Property card pshell.301.5
         Added - New property applied to all shells.
         Added - Nodal representation of center engine and RBE3 connection to octaweb. Engine node ID is
                 15000 and is SPC'd in all DOF to counteract applied aero loads.
       Removed - "Reaction" landing loads on fin-Legs.
       
07/22/19 Added - OpenVSP model and mesh.
       Removed - Old mesh files and lines drawings.
         Added - Load Development Notebook with basic functions for pressure derivation and EID list
                 extraction.
         
07/23/19 Added - Initial properties in VSP model for export and grouping. VSP automatically creates
                 SETs for each sub part, so this isn't completely necessary, but may make grouping easier.
 
07/26/19 Added - Importing multiple parts into a single Patran database seems to exceed the entity limits
                 on the Student Edition license. Unverified, but elements import and then disappear. Error
                 message upon closing seems to verify, but the numerical limit is still unknown. Some
                 simplification can be done on the wings and canards, but if just 3 "items" run into the
                 limit, major coarsening may be necessary just to stay under limit. Will try with
                 extremely coarse mesh.

07/26/19 Added - Mesh coarsened overall. 2 elements in the canard deck seemed to cause issues, so they
                 were commented out and import  was successful.
