   MSC Nastran brings powerful new features and enhancements for engineering
   solutions.
  
     Dynamics
     -  Structural and Fluid Material property specification can now be
        frequency dependent.
     -  Anisotropic structural damping can be defined for composite
        materials. Restriction removed that damping is proportional to
        stiffness.
     -  Spatial definition of property and material now available.
     -  Direct export of AVL EXCITE .exb input file eliminating
        the need for creation and translation of intermediate OP2 and OP4
        files.
     -  The AVL interface provides Efficient External Superelement based
        Frequency Response and Transient Response data recovery. Virtual
        mass is supported.
     -  Structural damping in modal transient analysis now available using
        all the requested analysis modes using PARAM,WMODAL.
  
     Linear Buckling
1    -  Linear Buckling with local exclusion of differential stiffness in SOL
        105 with use of PARAM,EXCLUDE. Subcases with different exclude
        values are allowed.
  
     Rotordynamics
     -  Enhanced Mode-Tracking for Campbell Diagrams. Two new methods
        introduced: Numerical Slope-Continuity and Eigenvector-Based.
     -  Rotors can now be included in upstream Part Superelements for
        both single and multi-level assemblies for 1D, 2D and 3D rotors.
     -  Support for definition of CBUSH2D element cross-coupling terms
        for 1D rotor defined using ROTORG for both SYNC and ASYNC analysis.
     -  Improved output in complex eigenvalue for rotor whirl for 1D rotor
        defined using ROTORG for both SYNC and ASYNC analysis.
     -  Account for PARAM,WTMASS in unbalance loads for frequency response
        analysis.
     -  Account for PARAM,WTMASS in rotor mass summary for 2D and 3D rotors.
  
     Multiple-Mass Configuration
     -  Easy definition and analysis of multiple mass cases in a single run.
        Supported in SOL 101, 103, 107/110, 108/111, 109/112, 144, 145, 146,
        200 and 400 solution sequences.
  
     Optimization
     -  Shell stress constraints can now be defined for Topology Optimization.
  
     Assembly
     -  New modules that can assemble multiple Bulk Data sections to form a
        single MSC Nastran input file. Modules are analogous to part
        superelements without reduction and are supported in SOL 101 - 112.
  
     Implicit Nonlinear Analysis - SOL 400
     -  GPFORCE Output with Contact.
     -  Automatic Contact Generation.
     -  External Superelements Creation, Assembly and Data Recovery.
     -  CFAST Fastener element enabled to FUSE based on load criteria.
     -  Support contact model check for Node-to-Surface contact:
        -  Show the GRIDs movement in initial stress free.
        -  Show the Contact bodies distance (overlap/gap).
        -  Output Analytical analysis data.
        -  Also fully support SOL 101; SOL 103 - SOL 112 in the initial
           Condition.
  
     Linear Statics
     - Bar end load calculations are available for PANEL(Shell)/STRINGER(bar or
       beam) construction and associated shear flows with use of the Case
       Control BENDL command.
  
     Explicit Nonlinear Analysis - SOL 700
     -  Automated Coupling Surfaces.
     -  New SOL 700 Dytran, Dytran under Nastran.
1    -  A new translator, DEMATD, can convert materials where possible,
        from old SOL 700 to the new SOL 700.
     -  A new document is also published on which this translator is based upon.
  
  
     HPC
     -  Improved performance and scalability for [K4] reduction using ACMS
     -  New MPYAD with better parallel performance and better method
        selection.
     -  New command line option, solve=auto and cpumax=N, to automatically
        choose optimal solver and parallel options based on hardware and
        the model.
     -  Increased efficiency and reduced I/O for SOL 103 with full data recovery
     -  SOLVE=AUTO enhancements for SOL 108 and 3D models.
     -  Enhanced MPYAD for sparse matrices.
  
     Results HDF5 Database
     -  Additional data blocks have been added to the HDF5 file: OEFTGV,
        OMONPNT, TOMVAR, TOPVAR, R1TABRD, HISADD, RESP12, WETFACES, META,
        OFCRFM, EPTFSP, MPTFSP, TRNUORD, and UHT, as well as modal and
        Rotordynamic matrices.
     -  Output Contact bodies distance and status check information.
     -  Output Analytical spline table of deformable contact body.
